    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>Last Revised: February 20, 2018</h2>

    Welcome to the service provided by developers and those involved in creation of Llama (henceforth referred collectively as “uddoit”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). This Privacy Policy has been created to provide information about our company, our website and the services we provide (collectively, the “Services”) to our users (“you” and/or “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth uddoit’s policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”), that is collected from users of the Services.

    <h2>
    Information We Collect:
    When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:
    </h2>

    <p>
    Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information such as when you register for access to the Services, use certain Services, contact us with inquiries or respond to one of our surveys. For example, we may collect information including but limited to your name, email address, and the messages you send or receive through the Services. Wherever uddoit collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.

    By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of uddoit and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States. uddoit shall maintain the confidentiality of your personal data, as described in this privacy policy.
    </p>
    <h2>Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data:</h2><p> When you interact with uddoit through the Services, we also receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. uddoit may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by uddoit affiliates, agents or service providers. By making use of uddoit services you authorize uddoit to use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors or users of the Services, the number of visitors to each page of our website, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Service. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, uddoit may conduct research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. Because this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally, uddoit may share the same with its affiliates, agents and business partners. uddoit may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

    In operating the Services, we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Services may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Services. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service’s features.

    Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information
    uddoit uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, you authorize uddoit to use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the uddoit Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. uddoit and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users, and to improve the uddoit Services. By accessing uddoit services you authorize uddoit and its Related Companies to use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.
    If uddoit intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.

    </p>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information
  </p><h2>uddoit is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which your use of uddoit services authorizes uddoit to share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</h2><p>
    <h2>Rewards Providers:</h2><p> To the extent you have obtained or redeemed a reward offered by a merchant (“Rewards Providers”), added a Reward Provider as a membership to your account or otherwise participated in any other activity sponsored or offered through the Service on behalf of the Rewards Provider, we may provide such Rewards Providers with your Personal Data (a) in order for the Rewards Provider to redeem and validate your reward, send you customized offers, troubleshoot redemption, combat fraud and otherwise communicate with you, (b) as part of legal proceedings affecting uddoit and the Rewards Provider, or (c) to facilitate a direct relationship between the Rewards Provider and you.
      </p>

When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function, and further require them to hold all information they receive confidential. We also disclose automatically collected data (card scans, promotional activities, and redemption information) to our Rewards Provider, third-party ad servers and advertisers. These third parties may match this data with information that they have previously collected about you under their own privacy policies, which you should consult on a regular basis.

      </p>
    <h2>With the Ability to Opt-Out:</h2><p> We do not share Personal Data with other third-party organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your consent except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-out. We may offer contests that require you to take an action in order to receive a reward. This data is provided to the advertiser and you will always have the option to not participate.The Services will automatically send you SMS messages with updates and other information as part of the Services.

    In the course of using uddoit Services, you may obtain private or confidential information pertaining to uddoit or to other parties. You promise to not disclose or use such data or information to any party for any purpose, commercial or not, without the express written permission of uddoit or the party whose private information you have obtained.
    </p>
    <h2>Exclusions:</h2><p>
    This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by uddoit other than Personal Data collected through the Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to uddoit through the Services or any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Services, such as public forums (collectively, “Public Areas”), any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and uddoit shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute and exploit such Unsolicited Information without limitation or attribution.
    </p>
    <h2>Children:</h2><p>
    uddoit does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on the Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to uddoit through the Services, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.
    </p>
    <h2>Links to Other Web Sites:</h2><p>
    This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by uddoit (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that uddoit endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.
    </p>
    <h2>Security:</h2><p>
    uddoit takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet, email, mobile or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us in this way. Upon using uddoit services, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless uddoit from any claims, demands or harm you may experience in respect to security breaches.
    </p>
    <h2>Do Not Track:</h2><p>
    uddoit does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are redirected to such sites, please set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.

    Third parties that have content embedded on uddoit’s websites such as a social feature may set cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited a specific website from a certain IP address. Third parties cannot collect any other personally identifiable information from uddoit’s websites unless you provide it to them directly.
